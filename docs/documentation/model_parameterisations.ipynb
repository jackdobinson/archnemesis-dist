    "## Implemented model parameterisations\n",
    "\n",
    "The model parameterisations have the purpose of modifying the information in the reference classes according to a smaller number of parameters. This is especially important for retrievals, when these parameters are modified in each iteration to find the best fit between the modelled and measured spectra. Each of the model parameterisations is defined by some Variable IDs and Variable parameters, which are defined in the *.apr* file. This file can be read using the *read_apr* function on the Variables class. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, only a number of models have been implemented in archNEMESIS with respect to NEMESIS. Detailed information about each of the model parameterisations is included in the Examples. In the following table, a bried summary describing each of these models is included:::\n",

    "It is possible that the users may want to define their own custom parameterisations, to create new retrieval schemes for the specific purposes. In order to do so, one must implement the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select one model parameterisation ID number, considering the numbers already taken by others.\n",
    "2. Open the file for the class *Variables_0.py*, and change the function *read_apr()* to tell archNEMESIS how to read this parameterisation from the *.apr* file. In this function, different fields must be properly filled:\n",
    "   - Variables.VARIDENT : This field represents the Variable IDs, unique for this model parameterisation.\n",
    "   - Variables.VARPARAM : This field represents any extra parameters the code needs to read to properly represent the parameterisation, but that will not be retrieved (i.e., they are not included in the state vector).\n",
    "   - Variables.XA : This field represents the state vector and must be filled accordingly based on the parameters stored on the *.apr* file.\n",
    "   - Variables.SA : This field represents the a priori covariance matrix and must be filled accordingly based on the parameters stored on the *.apr* file.\n",
    "   - Variables.LX : This field tells whether a particular element of the state vector is carried in log-scale.\n",
    "   - Variables.NUM : This field tells whether the jacobian matrix for this particular element of the state vector can be computed analytically (0) or numerically (1).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Open the file for the class *Variables_0.py*, and change the function *calc_NXVAR()* to tell archNEMESIS the number of parameters in the state vector associated with this particular model parameterisation.\n",
    "4. Open the file *subprofretg.py*, which maps the variables of the state vector to the different classes included in the forward model (e.g., Atmosphere, Surface...), as well as the gradients in the case that these are calculated analytically.\n"
