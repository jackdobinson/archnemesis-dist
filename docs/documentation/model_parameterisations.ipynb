    "The Atmosphere class includes information, as its name suggests, about the planetary atmosphere we want to model. In particular, it includes information about the planet basic properties (e.g. mass, radius), and more specifically about its atmosphere including the reference vertical profiles for the gaseous species (e.g., altitude, pressure, temperature, gas mixing ratios), as well as for the suspended aerosols in the atmosphere (e.g., dust particles, clouds, etc.). For most applications, the atmosphere of a single column of the planet needs to be defined at a specified latitude and longitude. Nevertheless, the Atmosphere class also includes the possibility of defining reference vertical profiles at multiple latitudes and longitudes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The model parameterisations have the purpose of modifying the information in the reference classes according to a smaller number of parameters. This is especially important for retrievals, when these parameters are modified in each iteration to find the best fit between the modelled and measured spectra. Each of the model parameterisations is defined by some Variable IDs and Variable parameters, which are defined in the *.apr* file. This file can be read using the *read_apr* function on the Variables class. \n",

    "At this stage, only a number of models have been implemented in archNEMESIS with respect to NEMESIS. Detailed information about each of the model parameterisations is included in the Examples. In the following, a brief summary describing each of these models is included:\n"
