    "In archNEMESIS, all the parameters we need to simulate the electromagnetic spectrum of a planetary atmosphere are stored into several different Python classes. The sub-division of the input information into the classes was performed so that each class represented key aspects of the radiative transfer modelling, and aiming for the different classes to be independent from each other, so that they can be easily turned on or off based on the user needs. The reference classes hold the information that is fed into the forward model, but they might also be useful for the pre-processing or post-processing of the retrieval. For example, the different classes include methods to easily modify or print the information within the class, perform calculations using this information or produce diagnostic plots."

    "As mentioned, the units of the extinction coefficient are typically defined in cm$^{-2}$. However, users may prefer to work in units of optical depth. In that case, the extinction coefficient KEXT can be normalised at a given wavelength, so that optical depths at other wavelengths are relative to this. In order to keep consistency within the code, the aerosol abundance profiles need to be properly normalised using the Atmosphere.normalise_dust() method, so that the column optical depth for that altitude is given by 1. Then, we can decide to choose an arbitrary optical depth just by properly scaling either the values of KEXT or the vertical profiles."
