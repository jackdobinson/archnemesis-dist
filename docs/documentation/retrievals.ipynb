    "In order to obtain information about the structure and composition of a planetary atmosphere from its electromagnetic spectrum, apart from the radiative transfer model, which relates the atmospheric parameters to the modelled spectrum, we need a retrieval tool to solve the inverse problem, which allows us to estimate what atmospheric parameters provide a best fit between the modelled and measured spectrum. There are several algorithms and techniques that can be applied to solve the inverse problem, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. In archNEMESIS, two different retrieval methodologies can be applied: optimal estimation and nested sampling. \n",

Nested sampling (Skilling 2004) is a Monte Carlo technique aimed at efficient evaluation of the Bayesian evidence, but also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. Therefore, given a set of measured data, nested sampling will explore the parameter space and will provide information about the posterior distribution (i.e., the probability of model parameters given the measured data).\n",
