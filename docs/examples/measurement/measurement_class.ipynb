In addition, recent measurements of planetary atmospheres also include upward-looking measurements by instruments on the surface. NEMESIS can model the electromagnetic spectrum in any of these types of observations, but the fields of the Measurement class must be filled accordingly to set up the correct geometry. In this section, we provide examples of *.spx* or HDF5 input files for these different kinds of observations.\n",
